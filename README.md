🌊 Deep Dive — Immersive Data Stories from Ocean to Sky
🛰️ Frontend Visualization Using NASA Data — Future-Ready for Backend Integration
🧭 Overview

Deep Dive is an interactive web-based storytelling experience created for the 2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge, under the theme

“Deep Dive: Immersive Data Stories from Ocean to Sky.”

This project transforms NASA’s Earth observation data into an engaging, educational, and visually rich experience — helping users explore ocean heat, coral bleaching, and atmospheric patterns through an interactive map-based interface.

Currently, the project runs entirely on the frontend, but it’s architected to include a backend in future updates to fetch live NASA datasets and store user interactions.

🌍 Project Description

The web app presents a scrolltelling interface — a narrative format where users scroll through sections to explore different oceanic and atmospheric datasets.

Each chapter introduces a unique data-driven story using NASA Earth observation visualizations.

✨ Current Features (Frontend Only)

🗺️ Interactive Map View with global Earth imagery.

🔘 Layer Toggles for:

Ocean Heat

Coral Bleaching

Clouds & Aerosols

📖 Story Navigation Panel to guide users through data chapters.

🧭 Smooth and Responsive UI built with modern web design principles.

💻 Completely Frontend-Based (no backend or database yet).

🔮 Planned Future Enhancements (Backend Integration)
Goal	Description
🌐 Live Data Fetching	Integrate NASA Earth APIs (e.g., PACE, SWOT, GRACE-FO) to load real-time data layers dynamically.
💾 Database Connectivity	Use Node.js + Express + MongoDB (or Firebase) to store user interactions and session data.
🧠 User Profiles	Allow users to log in, save favorite layers, and track their exploration journey.
📊 Analytics Dashboard	Add backend processing for visual data trends, charts, and comparisons.
🥽 WebXR / VR Expansion	Enable immersive VR mode using backend-driven data visualization.
🧰 Tech Stack
Layer	Tools & Technologies
🌐 Frontend	HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
🗺️ Visualization Library	Leaflet.js / CesiumJS
🎨 UI Design	Custom CSS, Responsive Layout
